# ADK Web Client

This directory contains a client that can be run with the `adk web` command.

## Running the Client

1.  **Start the Streamable HTTP Servers:** Before running the web client, you must start the two streamable HTTP servers. Open two separate terminals and run the commands as described in their readme file.

2.  **Run the ADK Web Client:** Once the servers are running, you can start the web client. Run the following command from the root of the `mcp_streamable_http` project directory:

    ```bash
    adk web ./universal_client   
    ```

    Choose the 2-adk-web-client agent in the adk web UI
